In 5G, network slicing allows the creation of isolated virtual networks tailored for different use cases like:
•	eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband): High-speed internet for applications like VR/AR.
•	mMTC (Massive Machine-Type Communications): Supports IoT with low power and high device density.
•	URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications): For mission-critical applications like remote surgery.
This simulation models each of these slices, providing an environment to explore how resources are allocated to meet the requirements of each slice.
# STEPS TO EXECUTE
1.	Install Python 3.8 or Higher:
Ensure Python 3.8 or a later version is installed on your system.
2.	Clone the Repository:
Use the command git clone pate the  Copied URL to download the project files and navigate into the directory using cd 5g-network-slicing-simulation.
3.	Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional):
Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
o	Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
o	Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
4.	Install Dependencies:
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.
5.	Run the Simulation Script:
Execute the main script with python __main__.py to start the simulation process.
6.	Analyze the Output:
Review the results displayed in the terminal or generated as files, such as graphs or logs.
7.	Troubleshooting (If Necessary):
Address any errors by verifying Python and pip versions, reinstalling dependencies, or resolving missing library issues.
8.	Deactivate Virtual Environment (Optional):
After completing the simulation, deactivate the virtual environment with deactivate.
These steps ensure a smooth execution of the simulation and allow for a structured analysis of the results.
